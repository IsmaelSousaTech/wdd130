    <P>Hi guys, how are you 
        I'll introduce myself to you
        My name is Ismael Sousa, I'm 27 years old, 
        and I'm married to my beautiful wife called Lara Rayssa. 
        We don't have any children yet, but we do have a female dog called Hannah.</P>
        <p>I've been a member of the church since I was 11 years old, and I serve a mission at the former Salvador Sul mission, which is now the Feira de Santana mission. I've always had the dream of studying at BYU and learning English. I'm not fluent yet, but I'm trying to improve every day.</p>
        <p>My course at BYU is in software development, and I hope to enjoy the area and take advantage of my academic background in financial management and specialize in data analysis.</p>
